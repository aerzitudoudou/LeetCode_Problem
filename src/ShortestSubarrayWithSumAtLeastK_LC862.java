    Monotonic deque: maintains the index of St such that St is strictly increasing, and St inside queue are Si candidate

    whenever a St comes in to queue,
    - for Sk in the deque >= St , those cannot pair with St because St>=Sk+ k given k >= 1
                                 those also cannot pair with S after St because even it can satisfy S >= Sk+ k, index t is better than index k because t comes later to make the length of subarray shorter
     - therefore all Sk >= St can be removed

     - for those Sk in the deque with St - Sk >= k, update the res along the way with length t - k, and those Sk also can be removed before adding St inï¼Œ because for the future S having S - Sk >= k, t is better index because than k to get the min length

     -therefore all Sk with St - Sk >= k can also be removed before St's added to the queue

     deque saving the index of St for calculating the length
     T: O(n) all elements offer and poll from deque only once
